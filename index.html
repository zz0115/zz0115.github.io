			<h1>About Me</h1>

			<img src = "assets/images/My_Pic.jpg" class = "auth-image" alt = "My picture">

			<p>I have a background in finance and economics. Those are interesting majors, which get me to think about how the economic world works in our society.</p>

			<p>Sometimes I am a little annoyed by doing similar things over and over again at work. I always like to explore more. I want to learn more about computer science, since I like logical thinking, math-related, and technology knowledge and products. I'm fascinated by the ability to write and understand the coding language and apply it to enhance our daily life.</p>

			<p>I hope I can use this coding bootcamp as a start position to be a good programmer.</p>
