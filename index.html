			<p> I have a background in finance and economics. Those are interesting majors, which get me to think how the economic world works in our society. </p>
			<p> However, I want to explore more now. I chose to dive more into computer science, since I like all those logically thinking, math-related, and high-end technology stuff. Simply put it, the ability to write and understand the coding language and apply it to enhance our daily life is fascinating to me. </p>
